# 🪨📄✂️ First Website – Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the very first website I ever built.  
It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game — filled with bugs, imperfect code, and raw learning energy.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project was made when I was just starting out.  
> I know the code isn’t great — and that’s exactly why I’m keeping it here.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

- To track how far I’ve come as a developer.
- To remember the messy beginnings that shaped my journey.
- To never forget that progress > perfection.

## 🚀 Tech Used

- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No frameworks, no build tools — just raw code

## 💡 What's Broken?

- The logic isn't fully reliable
- Some UI bugs and missing edge case handling
- Definitely not mobile-optimized

## 🔥 What's Cool?

- It works (kind of)
- It was my first step into the world of web dev
- I shipped something

## 🧠 What I'd Do Differently Today

- Use modular code with proper structure
- Apply best practices and responsiveness
- Maybe turn it into a React mini-project just for fun
